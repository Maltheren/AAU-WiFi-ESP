# AAUWiFi - A wifi library for the eduroam network
So basically i have enough esp's i want to run at the universitys network, that i dont want to write the code every time... so i condensed it to this library. The library just run the a normal setup and connects with WPA2, so any other configuration can just be done directly via the WiFi class.

I must admit tho this copy paste of the code is untested, but usually it works... i think... gl.
